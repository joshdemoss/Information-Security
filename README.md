# Vigenere Cypher Decoder
Main File: findKey.py

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of both the Ceaser and Vigenère cypher by creating a program which uses character frequency analysis to decrypt Vigenère encrypted files given a key size less than 1000 characters long and a cipher text of sizeable length.
